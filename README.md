Initialized project zip folder on start.spring.io 

Spring Data: integrates seamlessly with SQL and NoSQL persistence stores (CustomerRepository extends ReactiveMongoRepository)

REST: On the Web you're a Reactive Microservice without anyone knowing it

Actuator: The application's health can be articulated by the app itself

Open to Extension: Spring Boot features loosely held strong opinions that can be easily changed via properties or pluggable implementations

Security (?): Effortlessly plugin authentication and authorization in a traditional reactive application with Spring Security
